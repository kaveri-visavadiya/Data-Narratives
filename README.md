# Data-Narratives
This folder contains Data Narratives that analyze two famous datasets (1. the U.S. News and AAUP college datasets and 2. Tennis Major Tournament Match Statistics dataset). The narratives ask scientific questions about the data and draw conclusions by using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib for effective data investigation and visualization. 

The U.S. News and AAUP datasets (in .txt and .dat.txt formats) can be found at https://jse.amstat.org/jse_data_archive.htm

The Tennis dataset (in .xls format) can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/300/tennis+major+tournament+match+statistics
